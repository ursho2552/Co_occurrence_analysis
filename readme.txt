The files in this repository were used to analyse the changes in potential species co-occurrences from the current baseline projections to future projections. The algorithm uses species presence probabilites to calculate potential species co-occurrences (similar to the approach in the biome paper). The presence probabilities were provided by Fabio Benedetti. The projections contain probabilities for zooplankton and phytoplankton using different earth system models, different algorithms, and different predictor pools.

The analysis was done for both the global and cluster scale. In the main file, some of the lines need to be changed in order to perform the global/cluster analysis.
