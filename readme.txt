The scripts in this repository were used to analyse the changes in potential species co-occurrences from the current baseline projections to future projections. This approach calculates potential species co-occurrences using species presence probabilites. The approach is analogous to the co-occurrence analysis in Hofmann Elizondo et al., 2021. The presence probabilities were calculated by Fabio Benedetti. The projections contain probabilities for zooplankton and phytoplankton using different earth system models, algorithms, and predictor pools.

The analysis was done on the global and cluster scale.
